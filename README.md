## My process
- Firstly i made the basic HTML structure by keeping in mind various flexbox divisions.
- For creating HTML I used the big screen layout.
- for responsive design I adopted the **Mobile-first-approach**.
- Then using CSS and flex-box I firstly made the navbar seperately with a common *.container* class for further designing.
- After that I designed the body within the the *.container* class using CSS flex-box, box-model and other properties.
- Finally designed the footer outside *container* class.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned
I learned a number of things regarding responsive design which are in below points-

- Using mobile-first-approach for responsive designing makes the work easier.
- Not setting width of navbar **ul** as it would be problematic during further modification.
- Using *em* units for padding, margin and *rem* for font-size (generally).
- For setting Width, use percentage units.
- usage if min-width and max-width.
- usage of modifier classes.
- various flexbox and alignment properties.
- Importance of naming conventions in CSS classes.
- Object-fit property for images.
- Negative margins can be helpful in alignment but they often cause overlapping so use carefully.
- Discovered meta tag (**user-scalable=0**) which prevented *zooming effect* in mobile devices<br>
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, user-scalable=0;/>

### Continued development
I will continue to learn further frontend developement in HTML, CSS and JS and various frontend frameworks (like bootstarp,tailwind,react,etc.).
